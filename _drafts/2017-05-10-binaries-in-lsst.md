title: Binaries in LSST
---

a convo w/ one of my [mentors](http://www.hws.edu/academics/physics/facultyProfile.aspx?facultyID=161), we asked a simple Q: what good are EBs in LSST? Besides the "EBs are fundamental calibration sources" in every paper about these stars

some very [interesting stuff](https://github.com/jlurie/decatur) being done with EB rotation vs orbit period on tidal synchronization

A silly idea turned semi-serious project: [tricycle](https://github.com/StellarArmy/tricycle)

LSST will recover [millions](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142...52P) of EBs
