title: On Creativity
---

In my blogging I am able to exercise my creativity. The pieces I enjoy the most seem to spring out of nothingness, an idea that just pops into existence from a vacuum, and then plants itself in my mind whereby I can think or work on nothing else. 

My observations about creativity:

- it is primarily hard work, and even the very best and most spontaneous inventors have generated mostly garbage
- Very original or creative work is often generated in short clusters of time, with long spans of mediocre or bad work between. My very best blog posts tend to come in clusters, for example
- People can be a great help, especially those dedicated to working hard.
- Feeling like a fraud is apparently par for the course
- People being harsh or critical is not necessarily a bad sign. Good feedback will sting, and you will struggle to recognize the difference compared with lazy assholes who want to tear you down.
- Water, particularly warm warm has something to do with it. Tea, Coffee, a Shower, rain, thunderstorms. There's something animal about it.



Working in Cafe's drove most of my progress for my PhD. Truly, during my PhD I did my best work and wrote the majority of at least 4 scientific papers at Cafe Solstice.

Some thoughts on creativity what drives good creativity and progress:

- a space to create
- a routine for creating
- a library of work
- bonus: other people to be creative with
- strong leadership, a [benevolent dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictatorship) at the helm

Examples of highly creative environments that intrigue me:

- [The Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Factory), highly productive and experimental
- [Building 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_20), very much an inspiration.
- [The Eames Studio](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665403/the-eames-studios-inspiring-history-and-unknown-dark-side), interdisciplinary yet very controlled
- can i find other examples?

Some [recent literature](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415624568/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=7EJX9UGADPLQ&coliid=I1DOA8LVNKJLCT) I want to brush up on, and the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity) article of course.

Like the idea of a creative workshop for science. Some facets of speed dating, incubator, dotastronomy, or Scialog
