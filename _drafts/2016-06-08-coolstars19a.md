title: Thoughts from Cool Stars 19 Part 1
---

have bunch of thoughts on differential rotation vs spot evolution

started at team meeting on Sunday, discussing spot evolution from K2. short time period, can we tell the difference? can every light curve be fit by both scenarios? probably a lot we can learn about spots by chopping the Kepler data in to quarters and seeing how much a single star can vary. but, do we really know what's going on in the Kepler data better than in K2?

lots of grousing about results shown not being able to tell difference, so they are useless. i disagree.

Andrew collier cameron thinks (and so do i) a good way forward is the phase-tracking diagram. this great for some kinds of evolution/spots
