  <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2017</span>
  <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/Moon_map.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I had an epiphany in early 2016: The moon goes through the K2 fields. I mean, of course it does by construction. K2 has to point along the ecliptic due to using the solar wind as a 3rd axis stabilizer. The moon travels along ecliptic. In hindsight, it is very obvious.</p>

<p>This provides a unique opportunity: <strong>Lunar occultation studies of K2 targets</strong>.</p>

<p>Such a project for community observers of occultations was described by the Occult software maker, Dave Herald, in this <a href="https://stargazerslounge.com/topic/229660-ideas-for-astro-society-project/?do=findComment&amp;comment=2479350">forum comment</a> as an idea pitched by <a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~jpl/James_Lloyd">James Lloyd</a>. The banner figure above is an example occultation in May 2017 of a K2 target observable from <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu">APO</a>, as computed by <a href="http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/occult4.htm">Occult v4.2.0</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation#Occultations_by_the_Moon">Lunar occultations</a> can be used to estimate the angular diameter of background stars. It can also be used to determine if a star is actually a binary! Check out these toy examples I coded up:
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/occult1.png" alt="" />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/occult2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Occultations allow binaries to be detected at <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SerAJ.188....1J">milli-arcsecond separations</a>, <em>assuming the stars are separated along the direction of occultation</em>, and can detect companions up to <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A%26A...397.1123R">11 mag fainter</a>! This means occultations could even be used to <em>detect</em> exoplanets with next-generation large telescopes.</p>

<p>Here is a nice review of the methodology and technical considerations from <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994IAUS..158...71R">1994 by Richichi</a>, where the author notes the field of occultations has been relatively stagnant for 20 years. Unfortunately more than 20 years hence, the same is largely true, and LO remain a <em>fringe</em> technique for stellar astronomers.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>The first and most obvious constraint to occultation work is the limited number of stars available for study. To wit, we only have 1 moon… though other Solar System body occultations of background stars are frequently observed (e.g. <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1963SvA.....6..525B">Saturn</a>, asteroids, etc), and are good targets for <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PASP..128a8011S">JWST study</a> - but these are for understanding the Solar System, not stars!</p>

<p>We are also put off by the need for very high speed imaging, often at infrared wavelengths. The events last only a few 100 ms at best, requiring an ultra-fast CCD or video camera system. The Signal-to-Noise requirements of 1-10ms exposures means that occultations are typically only possible for very bright stars, often V&lt;8.</p>

<p>There are other considerations for observing wavelength and telescope diameter, as we are working to measure the <em>diffraction</em> of starlight by the lunar limb.</p>

<h2 id="a-solution">A Solution?</h2>

<p><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001A%26A...378.1100F">Fors et. al (2001)</a> described an alternative approach to measuring occultations that particularly appeals to me: drift scanning. (First proposed by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994PASP..106.1165S">Sturmann in 1994</a>) In this approach we read the CCD (camera chip) out at a rate that smears the starlight over many pixels. Since the CCD read is at a constant rate, the time evolution of the event is preserved, often at a resolution of a few ms. Note we are reading the camera while the shutter is open. This is basically the opposite of what <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000AJ....120.1579Y">SDSS did</a>, where the CCD’s were read at the same rate the sky was drifting by, causing starlight to <em>not</em> smear as the charge moved along the chip, but gave continuous images of the sky. (brilliant!)</p>

<p>This drift-scan approach is attractive because it only requires an off-the-shelf CCD chip, and a little help from some adventurous engineers (e.g. the readout clock speed needs to be tuned, shutter needs to stay open, etc)</p>

<p>With access to lots of telescope time (actually very little time per object!), and minimal changes to a facility instrument, a survey of occultations for K2 sources should be undertaken! I can think of 1 or 2 medium aperture telescopes this would be ideal for…</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>Drift spectroscopy? Could be possible with a longslit spectrograph (one way time resolved spectroscopy was done in olden days…)</p>
