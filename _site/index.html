        Photometric Metallicities
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Apr 2017</span>

    <p>Here is a cool figure that I made with <a href="http://www.sarahjaneschmidt.com">S. J. Schmidt</a> a few years ago, based on work she was doing with <a href="http://www.sdss3.org/surveys/apogee.php">APOGEE</a> + <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/main/index.html">WISE</a> data for low-mass stars (see very relevant paper <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.460.2611S">here</a>)</p>

<p><img src="http://astro.ifweassume.com/assets/w1w2_rz_feh.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We added to her APOGEE work by including dwarf stars processed by the SDSS Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP).</p>

<p>What comes out of this figure is a potentially useful result: you can measure the metallicity of a star (roughly) using it’s WISE (W1-W2) color!</p>

<p>For M dwarfs, the [Fe/H] values can be determined by subtracting the measured (W1-W2) color from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1875">stellar locus</a> value for a given (r-z) color. This is a fairly small amplitude signal, however, with the offset in (W1-W2) having a max of +/-0.1 mag. The effect is less pronounced for earlier type stars (G-K) measured by SDSS, but is still in the same direction about the locus.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What is the cause of this signal?
    <ul>
      <li>molecular features that show up for cool stars and are metallicity dependent I guess</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If we update the sample w/ latest public data from SDSS (BOSS) and APOGEE, is the signal still there?</li>
  <li>Can we find more <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0014">cool dwarfs</a> in APOGEE? (&gt;M4)
    <ul>
      <li>(W1-W2) appears to broaden through M dwarfs. Does it continue?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is the signal at all measurable for earlier type (G,K) stars?</li>
  <li>Fit a 3D polynomial to parameterize</li>
  <li>Redo as function of (J-W1) instead of (r-z)
    <ul>
      <li>then doesn’t depend on SDSS photometry, can be done for <em>all WISE stars</em>!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>[Fe/H] map of nearby Milky Way?
    <ul>
      <li>use Gaia to pick only dwarfs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What I need: People who know more about the current state of the field for “chemical cartography” of our Milky Way. Is it still exciting to measure [Fe/H] gradients? Look for kinematic+chemical substructure?</p>

        Missing Transits in Kepler
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2017</span>

    <p>One of the more amusing SETI articles in recent memory is one suggesting lasers could be used to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08928">“cloak” a planet’s transit</a>, by essentially filling in the missing starlight occulted by the planet. This raises an interesting observable question: <strong>Do we ever see transits go missing?</strong></p>

<p>There have been <a href="http://keplerlightcurves.blogspot.com/2012/09/kic-10319590-disappearing-eclipsing.html">examples of eclipses</a> (i.e. two stars) changing depths over the course of the Kepler mission. These are neat, and usually attributed to the viewing angle of the system changing.</p>

<p>Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) are all the rage, as the slow drift/change of transit occurrence times points to additional planets/bodies in the system. What you observe is a periodic transit event slowly falling ahead/behind schedule as the 3rd body moves around it.</p>

<p>However this idea is much simpler, and driven by the SETI question: Do any transits fail to show up when we’d expect them to?</p>

<h2 id="game-plan">Game plan:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Get list of all available transiting planets in Kepler <em>without</em> transit timing variations (TTVs)</li>
  <li>Obtain long cadence (30-min) light curves for each system</li>
  <li>Using published periods &amp; times for transits, step through light curve and verify transit is present <strong>if</strong> data is available (i.e. missing data doesn’t count)</li>
</ul>

<p>On some level this is a “reality check” exercise. I would basically not expect to find any published planets to have missing transits, as I think this would cause undue scatter in the phase-folded data that would have led to their rejection. However given the entertaining SETI angle, <em>it does seem worth it to at least check!</em></p>

        Stellar activity with GALEX
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2017</span>

    <p>At the <a href="http://www.issibern.ch/teams/quasistellflare/">ISSI meeting</a> I attended on quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP’s) in stellar flares in Switzerland in 2017-March, we had a great demo of the time-tagged photon data from GALEX by Scott Flemming &amp; Rachel Osten, and the Python toolkit called <a href="https://github.com/cmillion/gPhoton">gPhoton</a>. This enables high time resolution (maybe 1sec) studies of stellar variability in the NUV (and FUV). Many projects came to mind from our group with this tool/dataset, including searching for QPP’s naturally.</p>

<h2 id="long-term-variability">Long-Term Variability</h2>
<p>Some sources available with gPhoton have data from up to 10 years of repeated visits with GALEX! This caused me to wonder about the possibility of seeing long time-scale variability in the UV, which we might use to observe stellar activity cycles using GALEX! By using a list of Mt. Wilson H&amp;K stars from <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJS...76..383D">Duncan et al. (1991)</a>, I wrote a quick Python script to ping the gPhoton database and count how many visits to each star were available.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>After corresponding with the gPhoton folks, it seems this may be a less efficient approach, and that an SQL-style database is also available for visit-level data that may suffice. Comparison of gPhoton with this coarser data is required!</em></p>

<p>Here is the decade long light curve for one star, chosen to have the largest number of visits available (over 70). Each data point is the median flux value within the visit. The evolution is very interesting!
<img src="http://astro.ifweassume.com/assets/HD_3765.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Next Steps</strong>
1. Create a similar light curve for every Mt. Wilson (and other H&amp;K survey) stars, looking for long-term variations.
2. Compare the gPhoton with SQL-level data, to ensure variability is real
3. Compare with the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...766...60G">Gezari et al. (2013)</a> catalog of variable GALEX sources</p>

<h2 id="age-activity">Age-Activity</h2>

<p>Following my recent exploration of rotation period distributions using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08563">Kepler &amp; Gaia data</a>, I was keen to see if the GALEX data showed any correlation between UV flux and stellar age. Activity levels traced versus stellar age with GALEX have been explored by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AJ....148...64S">Shkolnik &amp; Barman (2014)</a>, using stars with known ages from clusters.</p>

<p>Instead of gPhoton, I used a dedicated dataset built from GALEX observations of the Kepler field by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813..100O">Olmedo et al. (2015)</a>. Using the excellent CDS X Match Service, I quickly and effortlessly matched this catalog to the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJS..211...24M">McQuillan et al. (2014)</a> rotation period dataset. To get more photometry, I then matched <em>this</em> combined catalog to SIMBAD with X Match. In a matter of 30 minutes from the airport I was able to get the data to make this figure:</p>

<p><img src="http://astro.ifweassume.com/assets/galex_rot_test2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For stars with a small range of temperatures, we can see the NUV flux appears to decrease compared to the V-band as a function of rotation period. Here I use the NUV-V color, as it is distance independent, and small bins in temperature to minimize the effect of different stars inhabiting different ranges of rotation period causing artificial spreads in the color. The evolution of less UV activity with increasing age (rotation period) is in the direction that is expected. However, the scatter is quite large.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Improve sample selection with quality cuts for all data.</li>
  <li>Make similar plot for all available temperature bins</li>
  <li>Make plot as a function of Rossby number instead of rotation period</li>
  <li>Using a gyrochronology relation to infer rotation ages, plot the <em>expected</em> UV flux (or NUV-V color) from the fits of Shkolnik &amp; Barman (2014) versus the GALEX data.</li>
  <li>Can we see a saturation regime with this data? If so, this dataset may be a valuable and large addition to the available sources!</li>
  <li>(Longer term) extend this sample with rotation periods from K2!</li>
</ol>
